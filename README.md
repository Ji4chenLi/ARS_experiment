# ARS_experiment
Implement the ARS algorithm
This is a testing implementation for the ARS by replacing the linear policy with neural networks.

ars.ipynb is the original one based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055.

ars_nn.ipynb is the one we try to replace the linear policy with neural networks.

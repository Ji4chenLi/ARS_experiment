# ARS_experiment
Implement the ARS algorithm
This is a testing implementation for the ARS introduced in Simple random search of static linear policies is competitive for reinforcement learning

ars.ipynb is the original one in which the performance oscillate a lot.

ars_nn.ipynb is the one we try to replace the linear policy with neural networks.
